The laptop stand is made of nice material and is moderately heavy. It offers flexible angles and quite stable even if you are typing. Only drawback is at higher angles, it falls back when the laptop is placed. If the front of the base was made heavier, it could have been better. I have to place the keyboard or maybe some books as a counter weight.
Product is very useful for Neck pain members.
Very good quality product that anyone can buy without any hesitation.
I am very pleased with my purchase of the laptop stand. It is made from high-quality materials and has a sturdy construction that can easily support even large laptops. It also comes with adjustable height settings, so I can adjust it to the perfect viewing angle for any task or activity.The sleek design fits nicely into any workspace and looks great too! Overall, this is an excellent product that provides both form and function at an affordable price - making it a great value for money buy.
Its a good product, laptop firmly stands on it.But you can't operate (use laptop's keyboard) over it, it fumbles.
