5Super!Good phone but bugs are there for example the phone speaker works but call cannot be transferred to speakers. It hangs sometimes. I have 12 GB Ram and 256 GB memory. photos are good but potrait edge detection is not accurate at all. I have posted photos of all variations. Night mode is good but no telephoto lens so close up shots are not that great but best thing about photos is they have a natural tone which I love. However filters option is limited. Glyph is not useful for me at all. But al...READ MOREshivaraman nCertified Buyer, Bangalore Urban5 months ago17728PermalinkReport Abuse

5ExcellentI have been using it for 2 days and below are my observations:Battery: Pretty Awesome, It will last you a day even when you use it for social contents. I'm left  with 30 percent before bed time. Design: I was using one plus 7 pro, it had a curved screen and it was comfortable to hold. I feel a pain if I use this phone for more than 30 minutes. Maybe by the time it goes away.UI: One of the best UI experience out there. Buttery smooth (Sakkathagide).Performance: No complaints here, serv...READ MOREMukesh Kumar NCertified Buyer, Bengaluru6 months ago8914PermalinkReport Abuse
5Great productThe phone is even better than what oneplus was in the early years. Feels premium 1.Os - It is the best thing about it.

Os is so fast and fluid.2.Performance - Qualcomm 8+ gen 1 processor is well tuned with OS. No lag even during Heavy gaming like BGMI and COD mobile. Device doesn't heat much.3.Charging - 45 watt charger is good enoug...READ MOREAmandeep singhCertified Buyer, Greater Noida9 months ago37381PermalinkReport Abuse
