1. Good display -â€¢ Peak brightness is good and good visibility even in broad day light.â€¢ Clarity of the picture is good.2. Excellent camera update -â€¢ Portrait mode pictures are great.â€¢ Resolution of the picture has improved and can see more details.3. Dynamic island -â€¢ As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - Câ€¢ Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Donâ€™t have to be extra careful while packing :-P5. Colour - i bought it for my wife and pink colour was perfect.Note: This review is considering my previous phone was iphone 12.
Phone is not good camera and heating problem
There could hardly be a more hardcore Apple bhakt than me, but I am disappointed. This phone while being an absolute beauty is unfortunatey a heating machine. DISAPPOINTED.
Without use kiye hi phone heat hota rhta h Battery b kb ud jari kuch pta ni chl ra itna gnda experience rhe ga I phone ka to mein kbhi na leti.. am disappoint ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡
We have brought Apple i phone, in hope to get a good phone after spending heavy money it,s great disappointment that the phone is heating up heavily even for 02 minutes of use,the battery dried up automatically when idle with in one hour.Such defective piece apple and amazon are selling after taking high prices,great disappointment. Now after purchase we have to run to service center to repair brand new phone.. Misery of the situation.
Had camera issue in 6 days of purchase without any physical damage
Worst iphone I ever seen. I hate this phone . I hate this phone lot. I donâ€™t buy this phoneðŸ˜Œ
Heating issues even after 17.1.1 update
