CSE-508 Information Retrieval
--------------------------------------
**Project Repository (Group - 22)**

**Problem Statement:**

Due to the highly competitive landscape of e-commerce marketplaces with numerous sellers offering similar products, sellers struggle to gather and analyse competitor data and customer feedback manually. This inefficiency hinders their ability to optimise product listings and gain a competitive edge. Specifically, sellers face challenges in decision-making, particularly regarding identifying optimal pricing strategies. Without insights into competitor pricing trends and customer price sensitivity, it's difficult to determine the right price to maximise sales and profit margins. Sellers are unsure of what pricing strategy would work best and when or how much to discount products to attract customers without sacrificing profitability. An automated system that involves web scraping to automate data collection and unique feature extraction to perform analysis using deep learning models and various IR techniques such as TF-IDF can help streamline data collection, analysis, and interpretation across various platforms. Such a system would empower sellers with actionable insights to optimise product listings, address
customer needs, and ultimately enhance their competitiveness in the e-commerce market.

**Motivation: **

With the advances in the field of Information Retrieval, there is a very high focus on consumer-oriented solutions; however, there is very little work being done for the producers/sellers. We aim to provide a solution for sellers working on platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, etc. Often, sellers list their products on multiple platforms, which makes manual analysis impractical and prone to errors. Moreover, it is the sheer volume of data available on e-commerce platforms which motivates us to work on the problem even further.

Understanding market dynamics, analysing competitor products, and identifying effective pricing and marketing strategies are essential for success in the highly competitive online landscape. Additionally, interpreting customer sentiments and preferences from product reviews poses another challenge for sellers seeking to enhance their product offerings. There is a need for an Information Retrieval based-system that can gather, analyse, and provide actionable insights from competitor data and customer feedback to help sellers make informed decisions and improve their competitiveness.

**Goals and Objectives:**

- Utilise IR techniques to provide sellers with insights into competitor products and market trends.
- Optimise product listings by analysing pricing, reviews, descriptions, and other relevant data points.
- Enhance seller competitiveness by identifying opportunities for improvement.
- Improve decision-making processes based on data-driven insights.
